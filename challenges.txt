CH09
WHAT COMMAND WOULD YOU USE?
As stated, what command would you use to get keystrokes on a Windows machine?
Hint: You do NOT want the unicode value. (Also hint: You need to import msvcrt)
Last hint: You do NOT want the character echoed either. (Yes, these are real commands)

CH10
WHAT COMMAND WOULD YOU USE?
You need a random integer between two given numbers, including both numbers
Quite unusual for Python, actually. Nevertheless, you still need the command.
What command would that be?

CH11
WHAT COMMAND WOULD YOU USE?
You have a dictionary. Unfortunately one of the inputs are faulty.
Luckily, you know what was written as the key, but there is one problem..
How did that command go again?

CH12
HOW IS THIS COMMAND WRITTEN?
You have some variables, but at one point in your code, you need it changed.
To be exact, you need to do a bitwise right shift on it.
How in Jesus' holy sandals do you type that?

CH13
WHAT ARE THESE COMMANDS CALLED AGAIN?
ARGH!!! You've tried EVERYTHING, but these silly operators.. ARGH!!
You want to get a result by using an operator with two boolean values!
What are the three operators called again?

CH14
WHAT IS THE CORRECT METHOD?
You have some whitespace in the beginning of a string.
Wait, it's in the end as well! Hmm, that's odd. And annoying. Very annoying.
What method would you use to remove it?

CH15
WHAT IS THE CORRECT METHOD?
You like upper case letters more than lower case letters. They look a lot better.
What method would you use to return strings in upper case letters?

CH16
WHAT IS THE CORRECT METHOD?
You really love working with strings in Python. You write strings all day, every day.
Your program copies whatever you type and add it all to strings.
Unfortunately, you wrote something wrong, but the program still copied it.
How do you replace part of the string with something else?

CH17
WHAT IS THIS METHOD CALLED?
You have a function which has some math in it. Nice. We like math. *winkyface*
You also have a list of numbers you want to run through the function.
Now, you've heard about a certain method before that can help you..
It applies a given function to each item of an iterable list and returns a list of the results.
What's that method called and how does it go?

CH18
WHAT IS THIS METHOD CALLED?
You have gotten yourself into some cryptography, and decide to try and decipher a word.
Naturally, you don't want to do this manually, so you chose Python.
You have forgotten that method where you get a word backwards, though..
You remember "The xxxx() method returns the reversed iterator of the given sequence."..
What's that method called?

CH19
WHAT IS THE CORRECT SYNTAX?
What is the correct syntax to output the type of a variable of object in Python?

CH20
WHAT IS THE CORRECT SYNTAX?
What is a correct syntax to return the first character in a string?

CH21
WHAT IS THE CORRECT SYNTAX?
map() is a fantastic tool once you learn how to use it (I haven't used it yet)
What is the syntax for map()?

CH22
WHAT IS THE CORRECT SYNTAX?
The range() type returns an immutable sequence of numbers between the given start integer to the stop integer.
I totally did not find that description anywhere.
Now, the range() constructor has two forms of definition.
The first syntax is: range(stop)
What's the other one?

CH23
WHAT IS THE CORRECT SYNTAX?
bool() is great for making flags here and there.
What's the syntax for it though?
